Oaxaca-Binder Estimator for Treatment Effect: 

\textit{Patrick Kline - Oaxaca-Blinder as a Reweighting Estimator (2011)}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Run regression on Untreated units to get $\hat{\beta}^0$
   \[ 
        Y_i = X_i \beta + \varepsilon_i    
   \]

   \item Predict counterfactual outcomes for Treated units
   \[ 
        \hat{Y}_i^0 = X_i \hat{\beta}^0
   \]
   
   \item Treatment Effect is:
    \[ 
        \hat{\tau}_i = Y_i^1 - \hat{Y}_i^0 = Y_i^1 - X_i \hat{\beta}^0
    \]

    Can then aggregate to average treatment effect on treated
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Advantages to Oaxaca-Blinder:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't assume effects of covariates are the same after treatment, i.e. $\beta^1 = \beta^0$. This allows treatment effect heterogeneity based on $X_i$'s.
    
    You can explore heterogeneity in treatment effect
    
    \item Equivalent to Propensity score reweighting with linear probability model, so doubly-robust estimator.
\end{itemize}
